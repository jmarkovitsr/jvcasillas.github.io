After studying Psychology, I moved to Cádiz, Spain, where I taught English as a second language at a variety of different levels for around six years. I completed my M.A. in Spanish Philology with a concentration in linguistics at Middlebury College where I have been a student in both the Spanish and French Schools, as well as a bilingual assistant in the Spanish School, and more recently as faculty in the undergraduate Spanish program. I am currently a doctoral candidate at the University of Arizona where I teach undergraduate Spanish and Linguistics. My main interests are in phonetics/phonology, second language acquisition, and linguistic attitudes. My recent research has focused on native phonetic experience and its influence on L2 speech production, perception and lexical processing. I enjoy playing music, new technology, Casio watches and anything that has to do with el andalú.
