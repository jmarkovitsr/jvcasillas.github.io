After studying Psychology and Spanish Philology, I moved to Cádiz, Spain, where I taught English as a second language at a variety of different levels for around six years. I completed my M.A. in Spanish Philology with a concentration in linguistics at Middlebury College where I have been a student in both the Spanish and French Schools, as well as a bilingual assistant in the Spanish School, and more recently as faculty in the undergraduate Spanish program. I am currently doctoral student at the University of Arizona where I teach undergraduate Spanish and Linguistics. My main interests are in phonetics and syntax. Specifically, my research is centered on native phonetic experience and its influence on L2 speech production, perception and lexical processing. I enjoy playing music, new technology, Casio watches and anything that has to do with el andalú.
