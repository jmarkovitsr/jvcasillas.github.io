### Spanish 251

<strong>Intermediate Spanish</strong>
This course is the bridge between the Basic Language Program courses and the Upper Division classes. It is designed to improve reading and writing strategies, with a major emphasis on composition through literature and combines all forms of language skills (speaking, reading, writing, and comprehension) with intermediate grammar.
