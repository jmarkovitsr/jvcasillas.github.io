	<p>After studying Psychology and Spanish Philology, I moved to Cádiz, Spain, where I taught English as a second language at a variety of different levels for around six years. I completed my M.A. in Spanish Philology with a concentration in linguistics at Middlebury College where I have been a student in both the Spanish School and the French School. I am currently studying Linguistics at the University of Arizona where I am also a GAT. My main interests are in experimental phonetics and syntax. I enjoy playing music, new technology, Casio watches and anything that has to do with “el andaluz”.</p>
