After studying Psychology and Spanish Philology, I moved to CÃ¡diz, Spain, where I taught English as a second language at a variety of different levels for around six years. I completed my M.A. in Spanish Philology with a concentration in linguistics at Middlebury College where I have been a student in both the Spanish School and the French School. I also spent a Summer working in the Spanish school as a bilingual assistant. I am currently studying Linguistics at the University of Arizona where I am a GAT. My main interests are in phonetics and syntax. Specifically, my research is centered on native phonetic experience and its influence on L2 speech production, perception and lexical processing. I enjoy playing music, new technology, Casio watches and anything that has to do with el andaluz.
