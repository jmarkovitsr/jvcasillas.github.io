## Spanish 455

<strong>History of the Spanish Language</strong>
The purpose of this class is to study the history of the Spanish language from its origins to the present, with particular emphasis on two transition periods: from Late Latin to Old Spanish, and from Medieval to Modern Spanish.  Moreover, we analyze and discuss early and medieval texts that exhibit relevant phonological, morphological, syntactic and semantic changes, as well as discuss the nature of linguistic change and its place in grammar. (Taught in Spanish).
