## Current projects

- R-Snippets  
  This repository is a collection of snippets that I use in SublimeText3 for doing statistical analysis. The goal is straightforward: document the code that I use most often while doing linguistic research and make it readily available (and understandable) to other linguists. If you are interested in helping out, please mail me.
- LaTeX-IPA
