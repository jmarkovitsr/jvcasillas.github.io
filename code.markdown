## Current projects

### R-Snippets  
  This repository is a collection of snippets that I use in [SublimeText] [SublimeText] for doing statistical analysis in [R][R]. The goal is straightforward: document the code that I use most often while doing linguistic research and make it readily available (and understandable) to other linguists. If you are interested in helping out, please mail me.

### LaTeX-IPA
  I made this repository to simplify the process of using IPA in LaTeX. It is merely a collection of snippets for the package TIPA.
