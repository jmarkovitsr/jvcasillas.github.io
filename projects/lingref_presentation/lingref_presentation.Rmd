# Roadmap

## Functionality

- rating system
    - 'thumbs up'/'thumbs down'
    - display % 'thumbs up' with each entry
    - rating occurs in entry, but accessible from forum
- include multiple possibilities/translations for each entry (if suggested by users)
    - Ex.
        - English: 'voice-onset time'
        - Spanish: 'tiempo de inicio de sonoridad'/'tiempo de inicio de fonaci√≥n'
    - Entries listed vertically, in order of highest rating
- entry count in 'about' section
- google form to submit entries (same excel as staging)
    - from forum
    - from search results
- Definitions
    - include English definition with each entry
    - expand to other languages? (probably not)
