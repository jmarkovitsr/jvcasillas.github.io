This is how I made the colored spectrogram from the homepage (it's me saying 'welcome'). You need to load the package phonTools into R.


```{r}
library(phonTools)
```

Now you have to load the sound you want to make a spectrogram of (it has to be in your working directory). I recorded mine in Praat.

```{r}
sound = loadsound('welcome.wav')
```

Now we're ready to make a spectrogram.

```{r fig.height=4.28, fig.width=8.24}
spectrogram (sound, fs=44100, colors=TRUE, maintitle= "Welcome", maxfreq=5500)
```

We can also see the oscillogram by using

```{r fig.height=4.28, fig.width=8.24, warnings=FALSE}
plot(sound)
```


That's it.
