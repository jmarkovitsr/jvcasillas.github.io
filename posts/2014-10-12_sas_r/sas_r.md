I am taking a stats class during this (final) semester of course work which includes a lab component. In the lab we learn hands on how to do some of the modeling we discuss in class. The professor uses SAS for statistical analysis which, as an R user, is an interesting chance to see how different programing languages handle similar issues. A colleague and I have decided to document the process. Specifically, we are looking at the core functions in SAS and showing how we accomplish the same results in R. The project is ongoing and has been a lot of fun. You can follow along by checking out the [project page][project], which is being hosted on the personal site of my colleague, [Michael Marascio][Michael Marascio].
